      <title>Fake Review Generation</title>

      <description> To prove that public opinion of businesses can be easily manipulated by fake reviews, we generated a topic model which generates restaurant reviews based on real restaurant reviews. We aggregated, cleaned and developed a corpus of restaurant reviews from Yelp. Designed Marcov, LSTM and RNN deep learning models to train on the texts and predict the upcoming texts or characters. Obtained the most realistic reviews using the LSTM model.  </description>

      <title>Taxi Cab Trip Duration</title>

      <description>Designed a Machine Learning model to predict the taxi trip duration based on the pickup and drop-off coordinates. Used K Means clustering to determine the various routes across the city and predicted the trip durations using Ridge regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forests and Neural Network and improved the predictions using grid search techniques. Random Forest Regressor provided a prediction with adjusted R square of 88%, which can have a significant impact for cab companies to determine their pricing.</description>

      <description>Developed an object detection deep learning model to identify and count the number of tree logs in every truck image from the Georgia Pacific warehouse. Made an object segmentation tool to identify, segment and manually label the tree logs from the images to develop a labelled dataset using OpenCV and KL Divergence in python. Defined a deep learning model using U-Net architecture to predict the number of tree logs in over 11000 images with 78% accuracy.</description>
