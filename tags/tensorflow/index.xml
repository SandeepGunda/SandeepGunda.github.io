      <description> To prove that public opinion of businesses can be easily manipulated by fake reviews, we generated a topic model which generates restaurant reviews based on real restaurant reviews. We aggregated, cleaned and developed a corpus of restaurant reviews from Yelp. Designed Marcov, LSTM and RNN deep learning models to train on the texts and predict the upcoming texts or characters. Obtained the most realistic reviews using the LSTM model.  </description>

      <description>Developed an object detection deep learning model to identify and count the number of tree logs in every truck image from the Georgia Pacific warehouse. Made an object segmentation tool to identify, segment and manually label the tree logs from the images to develop a labelled dataset using OpenCV and KL Divergence in python. Defined a deep learning model using U-Net architecture to predict the number of tree logs in over 11000 images with 78% accuracy.</description>
