      <description>Work Performed:
 Extracted information and reviews for 200 hotels on Expedia by web-scraping in Python. Designed a SQL database for hotel information using normalized Entity Relationship model. Calculated the sentiment for customer reviews using Semantria for Excel and designed a Mongo DB database for the sentiments. Compared the sentiments with the hotel ratimngs for various categories.  Conclusion:
 Even though most of the hotels have a similar User Rating and Expedia Rating, the sentiments of the reviews often differ.</description>
