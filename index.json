Led a team of 4 and tackled issues such as peer â€“ profiling, unavailable data and false positives by feature generation and selection. Tested the data with Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVC and ADA Boost models to predict the quality of alert (High or Low) using precision and recall parameters. Delivered the ADA Boost model with a precision of 38.50% and recall of 78.48% for its high recall prediction.
