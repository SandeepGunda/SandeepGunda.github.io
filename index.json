Before the tournament, there is an auction to buy players based on the fixed budget for each team, with some limitation on the number of foreign players per team, number of uncapped players per team, etc. In IPL, the franchise managers have a task of building a good team within the budget cap. The players are usually selected based on different heuristics, past experiences, or at most some crude methodologies. Using the player statistics, want to build the best team possible for the lowest cost possible, using our optimization model.\nApproach: Each player has multiple parameters based on their role in the game, which determine the quality of the player. Batsmen have parameters like batting average, strike rate, runs scored, matches played, number of 4s and 6s, etc. Bowlers have parameters like matches played; overs bowled, maidens (overs bowled without giving and runs) bowled, wickets are taken, economy, bowling average, etc. Wicketkeepers are usually considered based on the number of catches taken.\nKey performance indicators:  Batting Performance: It is the sum of the batting averages of the batsmen in the team. Bowling Performance: It is the sum of the bowling averages of the bowlers in the team. Objective Function: Maximize the difference between batting performance a bowling performance.  Analysis based on data from 119 IPL players\nComparison: We tried to compare our team to last year winner to check how good is our optimization:\nLast year winner: 2017 Mumbai Indians We compared our team with Mumbai Indian Tea, with the same budget\n    Performance Metrics Parameters MI Our Team     High/low Budget 2830 2830   High SR 2249 2831   High Batting average 325 460   Low BowlerEco 781 707   Low BowAverage 150 107    As we can see our new optimized team better regarding numbers.
